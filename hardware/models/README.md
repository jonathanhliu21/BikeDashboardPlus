# 3D printing and models

These designs are just an **idea** of how the electronics would be encased and mounted onto the bike. They are designed specifically for my bike and will most likely not work for yours. They should only be used as a **reference** and should **not** be 3D-printed directly. 

The only part I 3D printed from this was a small piece that would hold my Raspberry Pi and my custom-made HAT. The rest I made out of wood.
