# BikeDashboardPlus

## Description

Over my spring break in April 2021, I made a bike dashboard ([Project description](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/jonathanhliu21/a-dashboard-for-a-bike-unfinished-6dc0cb), [Github Repo](https://github.com/jonyboi396825/BikeDashboard)) using an Arduino Nano, an LCD screen, and a GPS. That design had many problems. I could not put that many features on it because the Nano did not have much memory. It was slow and updated every 2 seconds. The LCD screen was very big and captured attention, which may have gotten my bike stolen. Because of these problems, I wanted a new design.



## How it works

## Problems I ran into 

## Problems that still occur

The bugs are listed below. I will try my best to fix most of them, delete them from this list, and create a new release each time I do so. However, some may be too hard or too time-consuming, or they may require a major change (e.g. a complete rewrite in code or a complete redesign), so they will be fixed in the next major release of Bike Dashboard.

## Upgrade ideas

I will try to implement these enhancements as long as they are not a major change (e.g. a complete rewrite in code, a complete redesign of the mounts and case, needing different parts, or a change in the schematics), or they are not too time consuming to implement (I have a very busy schedule). They will be released as features in a minor release.

## Making this project yourself

If you have a Raspberry Pi and a bike, and you are interested in making this project yourself, then [go here](docs/pages/make_yourself.md).
