# Contributing

Thank you for having an interest in contributing to my project. However, as I have a very busy schedule, I may not get to all of your contributions, but I will try my best. 

Before reading the rest, please read the code of conduct. 

## Reporting bugs and issues

If you have noticed a bug in the code or in your Bike Dashboard:  

- First see if it has anything to do with the hardware.
    - Did you wire something wrong?
    - Are all pins connected correctly?
    - **Note that I cannot change anything to do with the case or the mount because those are different depending on the bike.**
- Try to recreate your issue and take a picture or video of it.
- Look if your issue is already there in the open issues.  
    - If it is, then react with üëç
    - If there isn't a video already, reply to the issue with your own picture/video.
    - After this, skip all other steps
- If there are no open issues describing your issue, then:  
    1. Open a bug report issue
    2. Label the issue with the "bug" tag
    3. Describe the bug (what is happening)
    4. Describe how the bug was caused
        - Which mode your were in (bike or server)
        - Steps you made to produce the bug
    5. The error message in errors.txt **at the time your issue was caused**, if any.
    6. What you expected to see vs what you actually saw
    7. A link to the picture or video showing issue occurring
    8. Additional context: anything else you think is important to help me understand the issue
- If you think you have a solution for this problem, go to "Pull Requests"

If I find out that this bug is actually happening, then I will add it to the list of "Problems that still occur" in the README. 

## Suggestions/feedback/questions

- First check:  
    1. Does this have anything to do with hardware (the case/mount)?
        - If yes, I cannot work on it because it is different depending on the bike.
    2. Does this have anything to do with electronics (wiring)?
        - I may be able to work on the wiring of the different components, but this will be really rare.
    3. If an enhancement, will it be major change, and will it be very time consuming?
        - If yes, I may put this as a feature in the next major version of Bike Dashboard. 
    4. Is your suggestion in the list of open issues already? 
        - If yes, react to that issue with üëç and ignore all other steps

If the answers to the above questions are "No", classify your issue and then open an issue:

- Upgrade idea:
    - Label with "enhancement"
    - Name the feature you want to enhance and why you want to enhance it (are you annoyed/frustrated by something in the feature?) OR name a feature you want to add and why you want to add it
    - Explain how you want to enhance it or want it to be enhanced OR explain about your proposed feature
    - Label the files that would need to be changed for this upgrade 
    - Include links to photos, videos, diagrams, etc if neccessary
    - If you think you want to write the code yourself, see "Pull requests"
- Questions
    - Label with "question"
    - Describe the type of question:
        - Clarification
        - Question about a feature (what it does, how it works, etc.)
        - Questions about the project itself (how I made it, etc.)
        - Other question
    - Ask the question
- Documentation feedback
    - Label with "documentation"
    - Name the file
    - Quote the part of the file that seems wrong and describe what is wrong
- Other feedback
    - Label with "feedback"
    - Describe the feedback
